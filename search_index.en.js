For example to get the definition of the word \"replenish\" I use definition replenish on search bar\nBut this approach is still bit clumsy though, since you need a browser and if you are already opened multiple tabs then it is sometimes get messy around to switch around tabs.\nSo I found out this simple script from the book Linux Shell Scripting Cookbook, 2nd Edition that will query your word and get the definition of it.\nLet's see how to get it to work (I have altered the original script from the book to make is more convenient)\n\nFirst you need an account in dictionaryapi.com - http://www.dictionaryapi.com/register/index.htm\n\nAPI key for the learners API would be enough for the time being\n\n\nGet the script from here\nAssign your API key to the variable apikey\nMake it executable chmod +x define\nOptional: if you want to make it available system wide add the script to /usr/local/bin\nFinally you can run it as ./define replenish\n\nThe outcome would be:-\n\n","id":"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/a-simple-word-definition-script/","title":"A simple word definition script"},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/":{"body":"Intro\nSo you own an up and running Amazon EC2 instance. And you want it to access via hassle free way. This guided post will describe on how you can do it with few steps.\nNote: Just for the convenience I'm referring some steps from this blog here\nOK before I start assume you have an up and running EC2 instance. If so grab the public DNS from your AWS management console\n\nIt will be probably something like\nec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nOnce that is acquired I again assume you have already made your Key-pair and saved it while you are in the process of creating a new instance\n\nOnce that is also in place go to your terminal and CD to the location you saved your Key [your-key-pair.pem] and try to do SSH.\n$ ssh -i your-key-pair.pem ubuntu@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\n[the default user will be ubuntu for Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)]\nNow you should be inside the AMS terminal\n\nOk now you have to do is add your self up as a new user and give the root privileges (sudoers). Simply follow execute the following commands on to the AWS terminal\nAdding yourself as a user:\n$ adduser yourself\ngranting privileges\n$ sudo visudo\nfind the line root  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL and the line yourself ALL=(ALL) ALL under it.\nThen enable password authentication via (I used the nano editor)\n$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nPasswordAuthentication no to PasswordAuthentication yes\nAfterward reload the ssh configuration\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload\nOK now logout from the current session and log back as yourself\n$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nAnd to make sure everything is working just fine, execute following\n$ sudo -v\nYou will be promted to enter the password you have provided while creating the user(yourself). Enter that and if everything went well you will get no output on terminal.\nNow lets remove this troublesome password authentication replacing SSH RSA public key authentication\nTo do that first you need to create a SSH RSA public key\nSo logout from the AWS terminal and from your local terminal execute the following command (Just press return for all the steps)\nlocal-host$ ssh-keygen -t rsa\nAnd you will be promted as below\n\nNow what you have to do is add that key to AWS in order to identify yourself as authorize user.\nlocal-host$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub yourself@ec2-#############..compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/yourself\nThen again login to the AWS\nlocal-host$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############..compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/yourself\nAnd place the key file in right place\n\nNow you should be able to login without using a password\nlocal-host$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nFinally remove the password authentication and root user access\n$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nFind the line PasswordAuthentication yes and change it to PasswordAuthentication no\nAlso PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no\nFinally reload the SSH configurations again\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload\nThat's all you need for crating a new user account and allowing authentication via SSH RSA.\nIf you are still lazy enough to type that long public DNS you can simply assign it to an alias and place it in the ~/.bash_proflle  or ~/.bashrc to make it permanent.\n\n$ connect-amazon\n","id":"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/","title":"Amazon WS EC2 – connect via SSH RSA"},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/connecting-dots/":{"body":"While I was fooling around the Play store I found this recently released nice, simple and very addictive game. It's called the Dots. The funny thing about this game is that once you get started playing it you won't feel bored even it just has to do the same thing over and over again.\nThe experience that I felt was somewhat different from other games I have played before (but this could be only me). I think the main psychological factor that keeps me in the game is its simplicity and the options you get to boost your score and the opportunity you get to use those options. So there should be also a bit of a planning involved.\nTalking about the game basics there are two game mods \"Time mode\" and \"Moves mode\". In time mode there's a timer which runs for 60 seconds for a single round, so all your connecting skills should be used in this time frame. And in moves mode you'll get 30 moves to scream at in a round. I usually go with the Time mode because it is fun and challenging.\nOnce you filled your bucket with enough earned dots you can go ahead and acquire one or more above mentioned options. They call these options as Power Ups.\nHere I will list those Power Ups\n\nTime Stops: With this Power Up you can hold off your timer for 5 seconds and it requires 1000 dots for 5 tryouts. It's a pretty neat Power Up by the way. (In moves mode you'll get extra five moves)\nShrinkers: This Power Up just shrinks any dot from the board. You just have to double tap on a dot. It requires 500 dots for five tryouts and can be used only once in a round.\nExpanders: This Power Up I haven't used yet. As described it removes all the same color dots. It requires 5000 dots for five tryouts. This Power Up will definitely come in handy.\n\nThat's pretty much it about this beautiful game. If you are bored or trying to eat up some free time this game will certainly do the job for you.\nSo here's the Play store URL give it a try\nUPDATE\nI noticed something new in the game's About section. Actually it was already there but I wasn't so curious to check it out.\nThere are few sections, most of them has quotes of wisdom by an admired person.  But one of them has this funny little dots of all colors and you can tap on them, which will eventually makes a unique sound for each dot.\n\n\n","id":"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/connecting-dots/","title":"Connecting Dots"},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/":{"body":"Intro\nAs you may have already know the latest distribution release of OpenSUSE 12.1 ships with Google Go language. Go language was founded by Google as their very own programming language. It works like an interpreter language yet it has to be compiled in order to execute. This small introduction will show you how to set up the environment and run your first Go language program.\nInstalling Go\nActually Go language is a part of the SUSE 12.1 distribution so you will not get it out of the box that is you have to install it first in order to use it. So lets begin installing Go\nsudo zypper install go\nHere I have issued the zypper command to install the Go (usual SUSE way of installing packages from repos). It will probably install two packages. Ok after the successful installation lets check if it's available\nwhereis go\noutputs\ngo: /usr/lib/go /usr/share/go\nVoila.! so we got installed Go\nSetting up the environment\nAs in the Go guided tutorial mentioned we need to set up three environment variables in order to successfully compile and execute a Go program. So lets open up the /.bashrc file where you usually place your environment variables (because /.bashrc file executes with every new session)\nsudo nano ~/.bashrc\nplace three environment variables on the bottom of the file:-\n\n[ctrl + x to save the file]\nexport GOROOT – location of your Go source installation (/usr/lib/go) use whereis command to see that as used before.\nexport GOOS – Your OS type which is Linux\nexport GOARCH – Your OS architecture, in my case x86-32 (32-bit) so it goes as 386 [see here for more details]. Issue lscpu to check your sys-architecture.\nOk now everything is setup up. All you have to do now is open a new session, simply logout and re-login. or simply do a source ~/.bashrc\nFirst program\nAs this is an introduction I will grab the same \"Hello\" program listed on http://golang.org/doc/install.html#writing\nnano hello.go\n\n[ctrl + x to save the file]\nAs I did mentioned earlier Go is a compile and run language like C or C++. So you'll have to to take the necessary steps before you make your Go code to be executed.\nCompiling, linking and executing\n\nWill gives you\nhello, world\n\nNote: here I have used 8g, 8l because my arc-type is 32-bit (386).\nYou will notice a different formation on the guide.\n\nNow you have successfully completed your first Google Go language program. Pretty straight forward hah? To me it seems like that it follows a familiar executing process as in assembly language. So this is just a little heads up you can find more tutorials and code sample on http://golang.org/doc/\n","id":"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/","title":"Google Go on OpenSUSE 12.1"},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/how-my-terminal-looks/":{"body":"Background\nI think everyone of you geeks would like if your terminal looks cool and productive. And yes, I'm talking here about terminals in POSIX-compliant OS's, more specifically terminal in a Linux environment.\nAnyhow I will share you the details of my customized terminal configurations so you could get an idea of what it is really capable of doing and perhaps you would start applying the changes to your own terminal.\nSo to make it all happen I had to give up on bash and start using zsh. Because zsh provides some extensive support to terminal users and it is certainly feature rich, customizable  and cooler than bash. So all the customizations I made are based on zsh and oh-my-zsh (a really cool community driven project for managing zsh configurations)\nLooks\nIf looking at theming oh-my-zsh provides some cool and nice looking themes out of the box. But the theme that I'm using is an external theme and needs little bit more configurations before using it.\nIt's call bullet-train and to make it look right I had to install some fonts from Vim-Powerline. I also had to change the color scheme of my terminal to use Solarized (dark). Here I'm using xfce4-terminal that comes with Xubuntu, so I can easily change the color scheme from the preferences menu. I also make it a bit transparent to make it even more cooler.\nProductivity\nEnough of the looks. Lets see how is it when it comes the productivity. Here again oh-my-zsh provides some nice plugins that you can use to increase your productivity. I'll list down the plugins that I'm using\nPlugins\n\ngit - A very comprehensive plugin for git with lots of aliases for easy usage\nhistory-substring-search - Very useful plugin that will get you through your zsh history backwards-forwards via up and down arrow keys\nzsh-syntax-highlighting - this will highlight the commands we use inside the terminal\ncommand-not-found - will suggest alternative/correct commands instead of just command not found error\ncolorize - this will colorize the syntaxes for almost every popular sciprting/programing language\ncolored-man-pages - syntax highlight in man pages for easy reading\npython - provides lots of useful aliases to Python\nsudo - hit ESC twice and boom! sudo will added to your command\nweb-search - simply opens up your browser with the search query of yours in desired search engine i.e google whats the weather like today\nchucknorris - this plugin isn't particularly meant for productivity but it can get really humorous.\nubuntu - this particular plugin provides lot of Ubuntu specific aliases to ease up the day-to-day work\n\nOnce put these all together this is how it looks\n\n\n","id":"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/how-my-terminal-looks/","title":"How my terminal looks"},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/jaxb-maven-xml-to-java/":{"body":"Situation\nAssume there's a situation where you want to generate Java sources from a xml schema definition (xsd).

What you'll need is\n\nLink for the Jar:Kulla.jar\nJava 9 early access JDK\n\nOnce these are in place you just need to set the JAVA_HOME to your / path / to / JDK 9. Then execute the following -jar command:-\n$ java -jar kulla.jar\nYou will be entered in to the JShell.\nHard way\nNOTE: The whole build process can take up to 20-30 minutes or more, so brace yourself.\n\nMake sure you have set the JAVA_HOME\nYou also need Mercurial. If you are on Ubuntu just give sudo apt-get install mercurial\nThen the follow these commands to get kulla-dev branch built\n\nhg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/kulla/dev kulla-dev\ncd kulla-dev\nsh get_sources.sh\nbash configure –with-boot-jdk=/path/to/jdk1.9\nmake clean images\nmake install  (optional)\n\n\n\nOK, kulla-dev branch is now built, hopefully without any errors.

It may feel relentless at times, especially compared to more permissive languages like Python, JavaScript, or even Java. But here's the key: that friction is the point. Rust doesn't just run your code safely—it teaches you to think differently about correctness, safety, and performance.\nIn this post, we'll break down the key concepts that make Rust unique and walk through what the compiler enforces—and why that's a good thing in the long run.\n\n1. Strict Type System\nRust's type system is precise, and it expects you to be explicit about what types you're working with. There's no silent coercion between mismatched types. This can feel rigid at first, but it eliminates entire classes of bugs you'd otherwise only see at runtime.\nExample: Type mismatch\n\nRust won't implicitly convert between u32 and i32. You'll need to cast it explicitly:\n\nThis forces you to make conversion decisions intentionally and not by accident.\n\n2. Error Handling: No Exceptions\nRust does not have exceptions. Instead, it uses the Result&lt;T, E&gt; and Option&lt;T&gt; types for fallible operations. You must explicitly handle errors or propagate them. Ignoring them is not allowed.\nExample: Required handling of Result\n\nTo resolve this, you can either handle the error:\n\nOr propagate it using the ? operator in a function that returns a Result:\n\nThis enforces a programming style where failure is expected and dealt with.\n\n3. Immutability by Default\nVariables are immutable unless explicitly marked otherwise. This encourages predictability and thread-safety, even in single-threaded contexts.\nExample: Immutable variable\n\nThe correct way:\n\nThis simple rule helps reduce bugs from unintended mutation, especially in shared state.\n\n4. Ownership and Move Semantics\nRust enforces a unique ownership model. Every value in Rust has a single owner, and when that owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped. You can move ownership, borrow it temporarily, or clone the data.\nExample: Moved value error\n\nOnce ownership is transferred, you can no longer use the original. This prevents bugs like double-free or use-after-free that are common in C/C++.\n\n5. Borrowing Rules\nInstead of transferring ownership, you can borrow references. Borrowing can be either immutable (&amp;T) or mutable (&amp;mut T), but Rust enforces strict rules:\n\nYou can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time.\nOr one mutable borrow.\nBut not both.\n\nThis is enforced at compile time.\nInvalid example: Two mutable borrows\n\nThe compiler ensures that you never access memory from multiple places in ways that could cause race conditions or undefined behavior.\n\n6. Lifetimes\nLifetimes are Rust's way of tracking how long references are valid. The compiler uses lifetimes to prevent dangling references.\nExample: Dangling reference (compile error)\n\nRust will reject this code, saving you from accessing freed memory. Often, you'll write explicit lifetime annotations in function signatures when dealing with multiple references.\n\n7. Concurrency Without Data Races\nRust prevents data races at compile time using its ownership and borrowing rules. When you need to share mutable state between threads, you must use thread-safe abstractions like Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;.\nExample: Thread-safe counter\n\nIn many other languages, this would compile fine but possibly fail at runtime. In Rust, the compiler ensures that shared state is accessed safely.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRust asks a lot from the developer upfront. You'll be forced to think about ownership, lifetimes, mutability, and error paths very early in the process. But once your code compiles, it's often rock-solid. You'll find fewer runtime crashes, undefined behaviors, or memory leaks.\nMore importantly, Rust helps you develop habits that transfer to any language: understanding lifecycles, reducing shared mutable state, and always considering failure cases.\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe Rust Book\nRust by Example\nRustlings: Interactive CLI Exercises\ncheats.rs: Rust best practices\n\n","id":"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/why-rust-makes-you-better-engineer/","title":"Why Rust Makes You a Better Engineer"}},"docInfo":{"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/":{"body":11,"title":1},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/a-simple-word-definition-script/":{"body":105,"title":4},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/":{"body":307,"title":7},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/connecting-dots/":{"body":226,"title":2},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/":{"body":271,"title":4},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/how-my-terminal-looks/":{"body":269,"title":2},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/jaxb-maven-xml-to-java/":{"body":139,"title":4},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/jdk-9-and-jshell/":{"body":275,"title":3},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/linux-fancy-little-dialog-utility/":{"body":43,"title":5},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/opensuse-13-1-almost-here/":{"body":74,"title":4},"https://rockyrx.github.io/personal-blog/blog/why-rust-makes-you-better-engineer/":{"body":412,"title":4}},"length":12},"lang":"English"}
