For me it was cover images. Each new post: open a design tool, stare at a blank canvas, export a PNG, wire it to the post. Not hard, just enough friction to make publishing feel heavier than it should.\nThis is a short note about shaving that yak with a tiny toolchain: a context‑aware prompt, an image model, and some guardrails in CI. No heroics—just removing a repeated decision so the writing flows.\nWhy automate covers\n\nConsistency: 1200×630 every time. No more odd crops in link unfurls.\nMomentum: publishing shouldn’t wait for “design time”.\nStyle: light background, a single accent, abstract shapes. Enough personality, zero fuss.\n\nOver time the manual step was turning into a speed bump. That was the whole motivation.\nThe bumps along the road (the important part)\nI didn’t get it right on the first try. Here are the lessons that actually mattered.\n\nModel and limits\n\nAt first I used Stable Horde for SDXL. It’s great and free, but CI doesn’t love queues. I kept seeing 400/429s in the logs (invalid payload or rate‑limited). Switched to Replicate with an API token; still got rate limits sometimes, but at least the errors were predictable.\n\nExact sizing\n\nSDXL likes multiples of 64. I request 1024×576, then downscale to 1200×630 with Sharp. Crisp edges, correct aspect for social cards.\n\nSlugs vs. filenames\n\nMy fallback logic assumed page.slug exactly matched the filename. It didn’t—some posts derive the slug from the permalink. I fixed the template to compute slug-from-permalink and look for /images/covers/{slug}.png. Simple, but that bug cost the most time.\n\n“Why is it regenerating?”\n\nCI starts from a clean checkout. If covers aren’t in Git, they disappear each run. I added a cache step that restores static/images/covers keyed to content/posts/**/*.md. Now the generator truly skips when a PNG already exists.\n\nContext in prompts\n\nPure tags produced vague images. I added a little context: title + ~240 chars of summary (description if present, otherwise a clean slice of the body). Still abstract, just more grounded.\n\nOne‑time resets\n\nSometimes you do want a full refresh. There’s a manual “Run workflow” input (force_regenerate=true) that bypasses the “file exists” check once. Good for style changes or a model upgrade.\nHow we decided on AI at all\nI tried three options in order:\n\nHand‑made banners (historically): high quality, low velocity.\nProgrammatic shapes: reliable, but too repetitive.\nAI with guardrails: abstract, brand‑aware, hands‑off once it’s set.\n\nThe third option hit the balance. The prompt constrains style; the model supplies variation. It’s not “art direction”, but it serves the post—and that’s the only job here.\nThe pipeline (nuts and bolts)\n\n\nScript: scripts/generate-ai-covers.mjs\n\nScans content/posts/*.md, pulls tags, title, and a short summary.\nPrompt (simplified):\n\nAbstract, minimal illustration. Tags: {tags}. Title: {title}. Context: {summary}. Vector‑like, clean geometric shapes, high contrast, brand accent #d64a48 on #f6f7f4. No text.\n\n\nCalls Replicate SDXL (model version from a secret), requests 1024×576, saves 1200×630 as static/images/covers/{slug}.png.\nSkips generation if the PNG already exists (unless FORCE_REGENERATE_COVERS=1).\n\n\n\nTemplate: themes/radion/templates/page.html\n\nIf a post doesn’t specify a cover, it tries /images/covers/{slug-from-permalink}.png and hides the figure if missing.\n\n\n\nCI: .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n\nRestores a covers cache before generation; saves it after.\nOptional manual input force_regenerate for a one‑time refresh.\n\n\n\nWhat GitHub Actions brings\nThe boring kind of power: reliability.\n\nEvery run restores the previous covers, generates only what’s missing, and embeds without a front‑matter tweak.\nWhen rate‑limited, the post still publishes—missing images pick up on the next run.\nA small verification stage lists the covers in public/images/covers and checks that posts actually reference them.\n\nClosing the loop\nThis wasn’t about making the site “AI‑powered”. It was about removing a tiny friction point that kept breaking the flow. The rule of thumb I keep coming back to: automate anything that steals attention from writing. Covers were stealing attention. Now they aren’t.\nAnd if the art ever needs a new feel? I flip the model or tweak the prompt, hit “Run workflow”, and let the pipeline repaint the edges while I get back to words.\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/ai-covers-on-autopilot/","title":"Covers on Autopilot — Why I Let AI Paint the Edges"},"https://noos.blog/posts/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/":{"body":"Intro\nSo you own an up and running Amazon EC2 instance. And you want it to access via hassle free way. This guided post will describe on how you can do it with few steps.\nNote: Just for the convenience I'm referring some steps from this blog here\nOK before I start assume you have an up and running EC2 instance. If so grab the public DNS from your AWS management console\n\nIt will be probably something like\nec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nOnce that is acquired I again assume you have already made your Key-pair and saved it while you are in the process of creating a new instance\n\nOnce that is also in place go to your terminal and CD to the location you saved your Key [your-key-pair.pem] and try to do SSH.\n$ ssh -i your-key-pair.pem ubuntu@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\n[the default user will be ubuntu for Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)]\nNow you should be inside the AMS terminal\n\nOk now you have to do is add your self up as a new user and give the root privileges (sudoers). Simply follow execute the following commands on to the AWS terminal\nAdding yourself as a user:\n$ adduser yourself\ngranting privileges\n$ sudo visudo\nfind the line root  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL and the line yourself ALL=(ALL) ALL under it.\nThen enable password authentication via (I used the nano editor)\n$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nPasswordAuthentication no to PasswordAuthentication yes\nAfterward reload the ssh configuration\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload\nOK now logout from the current session and log back as yourself\n$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nAnd to make sure everything is working just fine, execute following\n$ sudo -v\nYou will be promted to enter the password you have provided while creating the user(yourself). Enter that and if everything went well you will get no output on terminal.\nNow lets remove this troublesome password authentication replacing SSH RSA public key authentication\nTo do that first you need to create a SSH RSA public key\nSo logout from the AWS terminal and from your local terminal execute the following command (Just press return for all the steps)\nlocal-host$ ssh-keygen -t rsa\nAnd you will be promted as below\n\nNow what you have to do is add that key to AWS in order to identify yourself as authorize user.\nlocal-host$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub yourself@ec2-#############..compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/yourself\nThen again login to the AWS\nlocal-host$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############..compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/yourself\nAnd place the key file in right place\n\nNow you should be able to login without using a password\nlocal-host$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nFinally remove the password authentication and root user access\n$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nFind the line PasswordAuthentication yes and change it to PasswordAuthentication no\nAlso PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no\nFinally reload the SSH configurations again\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload\nThat's all you need for crating a new user account and allowing authentication via SSH RSA.\nIf you are still lazy enough to type that long public DNS you can simply assign it to an alias and place it in the ~/.bash_proflle  or ~/.bashrc to make it permanent.\n\n$ connect-amazon\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/","title":"Amazon WS EC2 – connect via SSH RSA"},"https://noos.blog/posts/connecting-dots/":{"body":"While I was fooling around the Play store I found this recently released nice, simple and very addictive game. It's called the Dots. The funny thing about this game is that once you get started playing it you won't feel bored even it just has to do the same thing over and over again.\nThe experience that I felt was somewhat different from other games I have played before (but this could be only me). I think the main psychological factor that keeps me in the game is its simplicity and the options you get to boost your score and the opportunity you get to use those options. So there should be also a bit of a planning involved.\nTalking about the game basics there are two game mods \"Time mode\" and \"Moves mode\". In time mode there's a timer which runs for 60 seconds for a single round, so all your connecting skills should be used in this time frame. And in moves mode you'll get 30 moves to scream at in a round. I usually go with the Time mode because it is fun and challenging.\nOnce you filled your bucket with enough earned dots you can go ahead and acquire one or more above mentioned options. They call these options as Power Ups.\nHere I will list those Power Ups\n\nTime Stops: With this Power Up you can hold off your timer for 5 seconds and it requires 1000 dots for 5 tryouts. It's a pretty neat Power Up by the way. (In moves mode you'll get extra five moves)\nShrinkers: This Power Up just shrinks any dot from the board. You just have to double tap on a dot. It requires 500 dots for five tryouts and can be used only once in a round.\nExpanders: This Power Up I haven't used yet. As described it removes all the same color dots. It requires 5000 dots for five tryouts. This Power Up will definitely come in handy.\n\nThat's pretty much it about this beautiful game. If you are bored or trying to eat up some free time this game will certainly do the job for you.\nSo here's the Play store URL give it a try\nUPDATE\nI noticed something new in the game's About section. Actually it was already there but I wasn't so curious to check it out.\nThere are few sections, most of them has quotes of wisdom by an admired person.  But one of them has this funny little dots of all colors and you can tap on them, which will eventually makes a unique sound for each dot.\n\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/connecting-dots/","title":"Connecting Dots"},"https://noos.blog/posts/cursor-payments-confusion/":{"body":"Cursor is a powerful AI-powered code editor that many developers are excited about. However, one aspect that consistently causes confusion is its payment and pricing model. This post attempts to document some of these confusions based on recent experiences.\nThe Confusion\nThe payment structure for Cursor can be unclear in several ways:\n\nFree tier limits: What exactly counts toward your monthly quota? Is it AI completions, chat requests, or something else?\nBilling cycles: When does your quota reset? Is it calendar month, or from when you first started using the service?\nPayment methods: What payment options are available, and how are they processed?\nUsage tracking: How can you monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges or hitting limits?\n\nThese ambiguities can lead to surprises—either unexpected charges or finding yourself blocked when you thought you had quota remaining.\nWhy This Matters\nFor developers evaluating whether to adopt Cursor, understanding the cost and payment structure is important. Unclear pricing creates friction and can be a barrier to adoption, especially for individual developers or small teams on tight budgets.\nWhat to Do\nIf you're considering Cursor:\n\nCheck the official pricing page (cursor.sh/pricing) for current information\nMonitor your usage if there's a dashboard or settings page that shows quota\nReach out to support if you're confused about billing or limits\nDocument what you learn since this information may not be clearly documented\n\nImportant Disclaimer\n⚠️ Please note: Pricing, payment structures, and feature availability for Cursor are subject to change. The information in this post reflects experiences at the time of writing and may be outdated by the time you read this. Always refer to Cursor's official documentation and pricing pages for the most current information.\nThe goal of this post is to highlight that these aspects can be confusing, not to provide definitive answers that may become incorrect over time.\n\nIf you've experienced similar confusion with Cursor's pricing or payment model, you're not alone. Hopefully, this clarity improves as the platform matures.\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/cursor-payments-confusion/","title":"The Confusing World of Cursor Payments"},"https://noos.blog/posts/github-actions-when-automation-meets-reality/":{"body":"When you first set up GitHub Actions for a project, it feels like magic. Push your code, and the CI/CD pipeline takes care of everything—building, testing, deploying. But sometimes, the magic breaks. And when it does, you learn things you never expected to learn.\nI recently went through a journey with GitHub Actions that taught me a lot about the gap between \"this should work\" and \"this actually works.\" Here's what I learned, without exposing too many project details.\n\nBackground: Building with Zola\nFor context, this blog is built using Zola, a static site generator written in Rust. Zola takes Markdown files and templates, processes them, and outputs a static HTML site. It's fast, simple, and doesn't require a runtime—just compile your site and serve the static files.\nThe deployment process is straightforward:\n\nWrite content in Markdown\nRun zola build to generate static HTML\nDeploy the generated files to a hosting service\n\nThis makes Zola an ideal candidate for GitHub Pages: you build once, deploy the static files, and GitHub Pages serves them. The challenge comes when you want to automate this process with GitHub Actions.\nThe Promise of Automation\nGitHub Actions promises a lot:\n\nAutomatic builds on every push\nConsistent deployment environments\nLess manual work, fewer human errors\nIntegration with GitHub Pages for static sites\n\nThe setup looks straightforward:\n\nCreate a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file\nDefine your build steps\nPush and watch it work\n\nBut reality has a way of complicating things.\n\nIssue #1: The Submodule Problem\nOne of the first issues I encountered was related to git submodules. If your project includes external dependencies managed as submodules, GitHub Actions needs explicit configuration to handle them.\nThe Error:\n\nThe Root Cause:\nGitHub Actions tries to fetch submodules by default, but if your .gitmodules file is missing or incomplete, or if the submodule path exists but isn't properly configured, the build fails.\nThe Solution:\nIf you're not actually using submodules (maybe you copied files directly), you have two options:\n\n\nRemove the submodule completely:\n\n\n\nConfigure GitHub Actions to skip submodules:\n\n\n\nI went with option 1 because I wasn't actually using submodules—I had copied the theme files directly into the repository. The submodule reference was leftover from an earlier setup.\n\nIssue #2: Branch Confusion\nGitHub Pages supports two deployment methods:\n\nGitHub Actions: Build your site using a workflow\nBranch-based: Serve files directly from a branch (like gh-pages)\n\nI started with GitHub Actions, but ran into issues. The build kept failing, and debugging CI/CD pipelines can be frustrating—you push, wait, check logs, repeat.\nThe Revelation:\nSometimes, manual deployment to a gh-pages branch is simpler and more reliable. You get:\n\nFull control over when and how you deploy\nAbility to test locally before deploying\nNo hidden automation surprises\nEasier debugging (you can inspect the built files directly)\n\nThe Manual Approach:\n\nIs this less \"modern\"? Maybe. But it's transparent, predictable, and gives you control when you need it.\n\nUpdate: Automation Wins After All\nAfter writing the initial version of this post, I realized something: maintaining two branches manually was becoming a burden. The workflow was reliable, but it required:\n\nRemembering to switch branches\nRunning build commands\nManually syncing files\nSwitching back to main\n\nThe Solution:\nI revisited GitHub Actions, but this time with a clear understanding of the issues:\n\nConfigured submodules properly (submodules: false since we don't use them)\nUsed a reliable deployment action (peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)\nSet up the workflow to trigger on push to main\n\nThe Result:\nNow I just push to main, and GitHub Actions handles everything:\n\nBuilds the site automatically\nDeploys to gh-pages branch\nUpdates GitHub Pages\n\nWhat Changed:\nThe key was understanding the submodule issue first. Once that was resolved, the automation became reliable. The workflow is simple and transparent—I can see exactly what's happening in the Actions tab.\nThe Lesson:\nSometimes automation does make sense. The difference between my first attempt and my second attempt was:\n\nUnderstanding the root causes (submodules, branch setup)\nUsing proven, maintained actions\nStarting simple and adding complexity only when needed\n\nThe manual approach taught me what was happening under the hood. That knowledge made the automation reliable.\n\nIssue #3: Missing Scripts and Assets\nWhen deploying to GitHub Pages, you need to ensure all your assets are included. This might seem obvious, but it's easy to miss.\nThe Problem:\nYour site builds locally, but when deployed, certain features don't work—like a theme toggle button that does nothing, or search functionality that's broken.\nThe Cause:\nJavaScript files weren't being included in the HTML. The build process generated the files, but the HTML templates weren't referencing them correctly, or the script tags were missing entirely.\nThe Fix:\nManually verify that all necessary scripts are loaded:\n\nCheck your HTML templates\nEnsure script tags are in the correct order\nVerify paths are correct (especially for GitHub Pages subdirectory paths)\n\nSometimes, the simplest solution is to open the generated HTML and check what's actually there.\n\nIssue #4: The Abstraction Trap\nHere's the thing about automation: when it works, it's great. When it doesn't, you're debugging an abstraction layer you may not fully understand.\nThe Pattern:\n\nSomething breaks\nYou check GitHub Actions logs\nYou see an error message\nYou make a change\nYou push and wait\nRepeat\n\nThis cycle can be slow, especially if your builds take a few minutes each time.\nThe Alternative:\nWith manual deployment:\n\nBuild locally (instant feedback)\nTest locally\nDeploy when ready\nInspect the deployed files directly\n\nThe feedback loop is faster, and you understand every step.\n\nIssue #5: GitHub Pages Source Branch Mismatch\nEven after getting the deployment pipeline working, some issues only surfaced when viewing the site in production. These weren't build failures—they were configuration problems.\nThe GitHub Pages Source Branch Mismatch\nThe Symptom:\nAfter deploying fixes, the blog post updates weren't appearing on the live site. The build succeeded, GitHub Actions showed successful deployment, but visiting the site showed old content.\nThe Root Cause:\nGitHub Pages has two deployment methods:\n\nGitHub Actions - Pages builds from Actions workflow output\nBranch-based - Pages serves files directly from a branch (like gh-pages)\n\nThe problem was a configuration mismatch: GitHub Pages was set to use \"GitHub Actions\" as the source, but our workflow was deploying to the gh-pages branch. GitHub Pages was trying to serve from the Actions output, not the branch we were deploying to.\nThe Fix:\nChanged GitHub Pages source back to gh-pages branch in repository settings:\n\nGo to repository Settings → Pages\nUnder \"Source\", select \"Deploy from a branch\"\nChoose gh-pages branch and / (root) folder\nSave\n\nWhy This Happened:\nWhen you first set up GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages might automatically switch to \"GitHub Actions\" mode. If your workflow deploys to gh-pages branch (which is common), you need to ensure the Pages source matches where you're deploying.\nThe Lesson:\nAlways verify that your GitHub Pages source matches your deployment target. If your Actions workflow deploys to gh-pages, make sure Pages is configured to serve from that branch. Configuration mismatches can cause silent failures where everything appears to work but content doesn't update.\nTesting Across Browsers\nThe Problem:\nDifferent browsers cache differently. Chrome might show updated content while Firefox shows old content, or vice versa. However, in this case, the issue wasn't browser caching—it was a configuration mismatch.\nThe Solution:\n\nAlways verify GitHub Pages source matches your deployment method\nCheck GitHub Actions logs to confirm deployment succeeded\nWait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild after deployment\nUse hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R) when testing\nTest in multiple browsers to rule out caching issues\n\nWhat I Learned:\n\nGitHub Pages configuration must match your deployment method\nAlways verify the deployment target matches the Pages source\nTesting locally doesn't catch configuration mismatches\n\n\nWhen to Use GitHub Actions\nDon't get me wrong—GitHub Actions is powerful and useful. Use it when:\n\nYou need automated testing on every commit\nYou want consistent build environments\nMultiple people are deploying\nYou need to run expensive operations (like building large projects)\nYou want to enforce code quality checks\n\nBut consider manual deployment when:\n\nYour build process is simple\nYou want full control\nYou're deploying infrequently\nYou want to understand every step\nDebugging automation is slowing you down\n\n\nLessons Learned\n\n\nUnderstand your dependencies: Know whether you're using submodules, npm packages, or other external resources. This affects your CI/CD setup.\n\n\nTest locally first: Always build and test your site locally before relying on automation. Automation catches mistakes, but you should catch them first.\n\n\nKeep it simple: If automation adds complexity without clear benefits, consider if manual processes might be better for your use case.\n\n\nInspect the output: When something doesn't work, look at the actual generated files. HTML errors, missing assets, and broken links are often visible in the source.\n\n\nVerify GitHub Pages configuration matches deployment: If your Actions workflow deploys to gh-pages branch, ensure GitHub Pages source is set to that branch. Configuration mismatches cause silent failures.\n\n\nTest across browsers: Different browsers cache differently. Always test in multiple browsers after deployment, and use hard refresh when debugging.\n\n\nDocument your process: Whether you use automation or manual deployment, document it. Future you (and your team) will thank you.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nGitHub Actions is a powerful tool, but it's not always the right tool—at least not immediately. My journey started with frustration, moved to manual control, and ended with successful automation.\nThe manual approach wasn't wasted effort. It taught me:\n\nWhat was happening under the hood\nHow the build process worked\nWhat could go wrong and why\n\nThat knowledge made the automation reliable. When I returned to GitHub Actions, I understood the root causes and could configure it correctly.\nThe key is to choose the approach that fits your project, your team, and your workflow. Sometimes that means starting manually to understand the process, then automating once you know what you're automating.\nAt the end of the day, the goal is to deploy reliably and efficiently. Whether that's through GitHub Actions, manual commands, or a hybrid approach, what matters is that it works for you—and that you understand why it works.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGitHub Actions Documentation – Official documentation\nGitHub Pages Deployment – Deployment strategies\nManaging Git Submodules – Git submodule basics\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/github-actions-when-automation-meets-reality/","title":"GitHub Actions: When Automation Meets Reality"},"https://noos.blog/posts/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/":{"body":"Intro\nAs you may have already know the latest distribution release of OpenSUSE 12.1 ships with Google Go language. Go language was founded by Google as their very own programming language. It works like an interpreter language yet it has to be compiled in order to execute. This small introduction will show you how to set up the environment and run your first Go language program.\nInstalling Go\nActually Go language is a part of the SUSE 12.1 distribution so you will not get it out of the box that is you have to install it first in order to use it. So lets begin installing Go\nsudo zypper install go\nHere I have issued the zypper command to install the Go (usual SUSE way of installing packages from repos). It will probably install two packages. Ok after the successful installation lets check if it's available\nwhereis go\noutputs\ngo: /usr/lib/go /usr/share/go\nVoila.! so we got installed Go\nSetting up the environment\nAs in the Go guided tutorial mentioned we need to set up three environment variables in order to successfully compile and execute a Go program. So lets open up the /.bashrc file where you usually place your environment variables (because /.bashrc file executes with every new session)\nsudo nano ~/.bashrc\nplace three environment variables on the bottom of the file:-\n\n[ctrl + x to save the file]\nexport GOROOT – location of your Go source installation (/usr/lib/go) use whereis command to see that as used before.\nexport GOOS – Your OS type which is Linux\nexport GOARCH – Your OS architecture, in my case x86-32 (32-bit) so it goes as 386 [see here for more details]. Issue lscpu to check your sys-architecture.\nOk now everything is setup up. All you have to do now is open a new session, simply logout and re-login. or simply do a source ~/.bashrc\nFirst program\nAs this is an introduction I will grab the same \"Hello\" program listed on http://golang.org/doc/install.html#writing\nnano hello.go\n\n[ctrl + x to save the file]\nAs I did mentioned earlier Go is a compile and run language like C or C++. So you'll have to to take the necessary steps before you make your Go code to be executed.\nCompiling, linking and executing\n\nWill gives you\nhello, world\n\nNote: here I have used 8g, 8l because my arc-type is 32-bit (386).\nYou will notice a different formation on the guide.\n\nNow you have successfully completed your first Google Go language program. Pretty straight forward hah? To me it seems like that it follows a familiar executing process as in assembly language.

It’s not just about learning a new syntax or mastering memory safety. It’s about engaging a mode of thinking that demands attention, clarity, and responsibility. In doing so, you develop stronger focus, sharpened critical thinking, and what might best be called responsible individualism. And when one person grows in that way, the ripple effects can touch an entire team or organization.\nIn this post, I’ll explore three interlocking themes:\n\nFocus — how Rust trains sustained, precise attention\nCritical Thinking — how Rust forces richer reasoning and choice\nIndividualism &amp; Contribution — how mastering Rust empowers an individual who then strengthens the whole\n\n\n1. Focus: Cultivating Attention in the Code\nIn many languages, you type, you compile, you run. Mistakes show up in logs or in production. With Rust, the compiler intervenes early and often. You’ll catch ownership issues, borrowing conflicts, lifetime mismatches—not after deployment, but at compile time.\nConsider these moments:\n\nYou borrow a value; you pause and ask: Who currently has access?\nYou annotate a function; you reflect: What lifetimes are involved, and why must this reference stay valid here?\nYou handle a Result&lt;T, E&gt;; you evaluate: What happens when this fails?\n\nThese are micro‑acts of attention. Over time, they build a habit of precision and presence. Rust trains you not to write just-sufficient code—but code you understand and own.\nWhen a developer learns this mode of working, the whole team benefits. Code reviews become richer. Discussions shift from “does it compile?” to “why did this compile, and is this the best way?” The developer’s focus becomes a team asset.\n\n2. Critical Thinking: Building Sound Reasoning\nBeyond focus, Rust forces you into deeper reasoning. Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, concurrency—they’re not mere mechanics, they’re invitations to think about how your code works, why it is safe, and what assumptions you’re making.\nIn philosophical terms, this resembles the concept of technē—the idea of craft or making, where knowing how to do something is inseparable from knowing why you do it. In programming, Rust becomes a modern technē: you not only write code, you reason about resources, validity, and correctness.\nFor example:\n\nYou ask: “If I pass this borrow here, could someone else modify the data concurrently?”\nYou reason: “If this value moves and the original is used afterward, I invite a compile error. Why does Rust forbid this? What risk is it preventing?”\nYou model: “When threads share Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;, what invariants do I preserve? What could go wrong if I slip up?”\n\nThese questions steer you away from simple feature‑delivery and toward thoughtful system design. And when more developers engage in this kind of thinking, the codebase becomes more robust, maintainable, and predictable.\n\n3. Individualism &amp; Contribution: Mastery That Scales\n“Individualism” often carries negative connotations—but here I mean a positive kind: an individual taking responsibility for their craft, developing depth of understanding, and then choosing to bring that to the group. Rust supports exactly that.\nThe philosophy of software craftsmanship frames development as more than meeting a deadline—it’s about mastery, continuous improvement, and professional pride. When someone invests the time to master Rust’s rule set, they gain both confidence and clarity. They can mentor others, raise standards, and uplift the team.\nIn turn, the team and organization benefit:\n\nDecreased bugs and runtime surprises\nClearer design boundaries and documentation\nA culture where thinking matters and craftsmanship is respected\n\nIn this way, the individual’s growth becomes a catalyst for collective growth. One Rust‑savvy engineer can shift a team’s mindset from “just ship” to “ship well.”\n\nPhilosophical Reflection: Craft, Virtue, and the Common Good\nLet’s step into the philosophical background. In the virtue‑ethics tradition, the focus isn’t only on what you do, but who you become by doing it. When you practise a craft with discipline, you internalize values: care, integrity, attention to detail.\nRust—as a programming language—is more than a tool; it’s a training ground. The rules around ownership and safety aren’t arbitrary; they coax you into a mindset of accountability. That mindset echoes technē: making with purpose, not just automatism.\nAt the same time, contributing to a team, a codebase, or an open ecosystem aligns with the idea of the common good. Technology can be shaped for more than profit—it can serve that which is good, beautiful, and durable.\nPutting those threads together: writing Rust becomes a practice in character as much as a skill in code. You become someone who thinks deeply about structure, consequences, and shared responsibility. And that transformation benefits every person you code with.\n\nConclusion\nWorking with Rust gives you more than faster performance or fewer runtime bugs. It gives you a path to sharpen your focus, refine your thinking, and develop a personal mastery that contributes to something larger than yourself.\nIf you’re a developer seeking to grow not just your output but your way of working, Rust offers a compelling challenge.\nIf you’re a leader or a team building culture, supporting your engineers in learning Rust can become a signal of valuing craft, clarity, and long‑term thinking.\nIn the end, the code we build reflects the minds we train. With Rust, the training is real—and the benefits run deep.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSoftware Craftsmanship – the movement emphasizing craftsmanship in programming.\nTechne – the Greek philosophical concept of craft and skill.\nJonsson, M.; Tholander, C.

And yes, I'm talking here about terminals in POSIX-compliant OS's, more specifically terminal in a Linux environment.\nAnyhow I will share you the details of my customized terminal configurations so you could get an idea of what it is really capable of doing and perhaps you would start applying the changes to your own terminal.\nSo to make it all happen I had to give up on bash and start using zsh. Because zsh provides some extensive support to terminal users and it is certainly feature rich, customizable  and cooler than bash. So all the customizations I made are based on zsh and oh-my-zsh (a really cool community driven project for managing zsh configurations)\nLooks\nIf looking at theming oh-my-zsh provides some cool and nice looking themes out of the box. But the theme that I'm using is an external theme and needs little bit more configurations before using it.\nIt's call bullet-train and to make it look right I had to install some fonts from Vim-Powerline. I also had to change the color scheme of my terminal to use Solarized (dark). Here I'm using xfce4-terminal that comes with Xubuntu, so I can easily change the color scheme from the preferences menu. I also make it a bit transparent to make it even more cooler.\nProductivity\nEnough of the looks. Lets see how is it when it comes the productivity. Here again oh-my-zsh provides some nice plugins that you can use to increase your productivity. I'll list down the plugins that I'm using\nPlugins\n\ngit - A very comprehensive plugin for git with lots of aliases for easy usage\nhistory-substring-search - Very useful plugin that will get you through your zsh history backwards-forwards via up and down arrow keys\nzsh-syntax-highlighting - this will highlight the commands we use inside the terminal\ncommand-not-found - will suggest alternative/correct commands instead of just command not found error\ncolorize - this will colorize the syntaxes for almost every popular sciprting/programing language\ncolored-man-pages - syntax highlight in man pages for easy reading\npython - provides lots of useful aliases to Python\nsudo - hit ESC twice and boom! sudo will added to your command\nweb-search - simply opens up your browser with the search query of yours in desired search engine i.e google whats the weather like today\nchucknorris - this plugin isn't particularly meant for productivity but it can get really humorous.\nubuntu - this particular plugin provides lot of Ubuntu specific aliases to ease up the day-to-day work\n\nOnce put these all together this is how it looks\n\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/how-my-terminal-looks/","title":"How my terminal looks"},"https://noos.blog/posts/jaxb-maven-xml-to-java/":{"body":"Situation\nAssume there's a situation where you want to generate Java sources from a xml schema definition (xsd).

It is named as Kulla and you can visit here to see the project's home. This is pretty much same like the Python's IDLE (If you have used it before) and a great way to exercise your code in real time. Also the good thing is that this project will be available as a part of JDK9 among with some other cool features.\nAnyhow I managed to get it run on own and have tried few exercises too. Here, take a look\n\nHow do I get it to run\nI haven't tried this on Windows, only on POSIX based systems (Linux).  But I believe the precompiled jar will work on Windows. You can give it a go and see.\nEasy way\nIf you want to try out REPL right away there's this precompiled Jar that you can use . What you'll need is\n\nLink for the Jar:Kulla.jar\nJava 9 early access JDK\n\nOnce these are in place you just need to set the JAVA_HOME to your / path / to / JDK 9. Then execute the following -jar command:-\n$ java -jar kulla.jar\nYou will be entered in to the JShell.\nHard way\nNOTE: The whole build process can take up to 20-30 minutes or more, so brace yourself.\n\nMake sure you have set the JAVA_HOME\nYou also need Mercurial. If you are on Ubuntu just give sudo apt-get install mercurial\nThen the follow these commands to get kulla-dev branch built\n\nhg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/kulla/dev kulla-dev\ncd kulla-dev\nsh get_sources.sh\nbash configure –with-boot-jdk=/path/to/jdk1.9\nmake clean images\nmake install  (optional)\n\n\n\nOK, kulla-dev branch is now built, hopefully without any errors. Now lets see how we can build and run the REPL. I'm extracting these information from official README under Kulla dev branch.\nDownload JLINE2 from Maven, and set the environment variable JLINE2LIB to point to the downloaded jar file.\nBuilding REPL:-\ncd langtools/repl \nbash ./scripts/compile.sh\nRunning:-\nbash ./scripts/run.sh\nIf everything goes fine you'll be entered to the JShell without any issues.\nFeatures\nI will add a summary of features that you'll find useful when using the REPL.\n\nREPL has networking support. Yes you can work with java.net\nSemicolone is optional giving you a flexibility like most of REPL's out there\nIt has some useful help commands that you can use to improve your productivity. /help list those commands\nChecked exceptions are not valid here. Like in normal Java environment you will not be forced to handle the checked exceptions. REPL will be handling it in the background\nExpressions will also work out of the box here. Arithmetic, String manipulations, method calls .etc\n\nHere I found a good tutorial that might be useful.

Everything was working fine until I ran cargo check and saw this warning:\n\nThat's not something you want to see. It suggests your code will break in future Rust versions. So naturally, I tried to upgrade the redis crate to a newer version.\nBut here's where things got interesting—every single attempt to upgrade past v0.25.4 broke the build. Not just small errors, but fundamental incompatibilities between the redis crate and deadpool-redis.\nWhat I Tried\nI went through the versions systematically, testing each major release:\n\nv0.26.x: Broke immediately. Missing TcpTls variant in the Tokio enum, internal TLS types incomplete.\nv0.27.x: Same issues as v0.26.x. TLS support partially broken.\nv0.28.x: TLS types like TlsConnParams and TcpTls were still broken internally.\nv0.29.x: Now it requires a connect_tcp_tls trait that deadpool-redis doesn't implement.\nv0.30.x, v0.31.x, v0.32.x: All require the same connect_tcp_tls trait.\n\nThe pattern became clear: somewhere between v0.25.4 and v0.29.0, the redis crate changed how it handles TLS connections, and deadpool-redis hasn't caught up yet.\nThe Root Cause\nThe issue is that redis v0.25.4 is the last version before connect_tcp_tls was introduced. This new trait-based approach is cleaner architecturally, but it requires connection pool libraries to implement this trait. deadpool-redis v0.14.0 was built against the older API and doesn't have this implementation.\nVersions between v0.25.4 and v0.29.0 are in a transitional state—they have some TLS support but it's incomplete or broken.\nCurrent Status\nAfter testing all these versions, I ended up staying with redis v0.25.4. Here's the working configuration:\nCargo.toml:\n\nrust-toolchain.toml:\n\nThe = prefix on the redis version pins it exactly to v0.25.4, preventing accidental upgrades. And pinning Rust to 1.74.1 helps avoid future compatibility warnings.\nThis setup works reliably:\n\nTLS over rediss:// connections work with tokio-rustls\nConnection pooling via deadpool-redis functions correctly\nNo compilation warnings or errors\nStable and predictable behavior\n\nWhat to Avoid\nIf you're in a similar situation, avoid these version combinations:\n\nredis v0.26.x–v0.28.x: TLS support is broken or incomplete. You'll get compilation errors related to missing enum variants or broken TLS types.\nredis &gt;= v0.29.0 with deadpool-redis: Won't compile because deadpool-redis doesn't implement the required connect_tcp_tls trait.\ndeadpool-redis v0.15+: Currently not compatible with stable redis versions due to the same trait mismatch.\n\nAlternative Approach\nIf you really need a newer redis version, you have one option: drop deadpool-redis and use redis's built-in ConnectionManager or switch to a different pooling library like bb8. But this means rewriting your connection pool code, which might not be worth it for most projects.\nThe Future\nThe situation is temporary, but it's unclear when it will be resolved. The deadpool-redis maintainers need to either:\n\nImplement the connect_tcp_tls trait for newer redis versions, or\nUpdate their API to work with the new connection model\n\nUntil then, staying with redis v0.25.4 and deadpool-redis v0.14.0 is the most stable path forward. Yes, you'll see that deprecation warning, but it's better than having broken code.\nBottom Line\nSometimes upgrading dependencies isn't the right move. In this case, the ecosystem has a compatibility gap between redis and deadpool-redis, and staying on the older version is the pragmatic choice. The warning is annoying, but it's not breaking anything right now—and when the ecosystem catches up, you can upgrade then.\nIf you're building a new project and need Redis with TLS and pooling, consider whether you can use redis's built-in ConnectionManager instead of deadpool-redis. If you're maintaining an existing project, stick with what works: redis v0.25.4 and deadpool-redis v0.14.0.\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/redis-tls-deadpool-compatibility/","title":"Redis, TLS, and Deadpool: When Dependency Versions Collide"},"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-macros-vs-functions/":{"body":"The Question\nWhen you first start with Rust, one thing that throws you off is the difference between macros and functions. Coming from Java or Python, this seems odd—why would you need both?\nWhat's the Difference?\nHere's the simplest explanation: functions work on data, macros work on code.\nIn Python, you write:\n\nIn Java, you write:\n\nBoth run at runtime—when your program executes.\nBut in Rust, macros run at compile time—before your code is even compiled. They're code that writes code.\nA Simple Example\nFunction in Rust:\n\nMacro in Rust:\n\nWhen you call the macro add!(1, 2), the compiler literally rewrites your code to 1 + 2 before compiling. It's like a smart find-and-replace.\nWhy Not Just Use Functions?\nMacros solve problems that functions can't:\n1. Variable Arguments\nEver wonder how println! can take any number of arguments?\n\nThat's because it's a macro. Functions need fixed signatures; macros can accept variable patterns.\n2. Code Generation\nPython has decorators like @dataclass that generate code for you:\n\nJava has annotations like @Override or Lombok's @Builder.\nIn Rust, this is done with macros:\n\nThe derive macro generates Debug and Clone implementations automatically.\n3. Domain-Specific Languages (DSL)\nA DSL is a miniature language tailored to a specific problem domain. Think of SQL—it's not a general-purpose language, but a specialized one for databases.\nYou can create custom syntax with macros:\n\nThis isn't valid Rust code—it's an HTML-like DSL that the macro converts into valid Rust. It lets you write HTML templates directly in your Rust code, which the macro transforms into function calls and data structures at compile time.\nMental Model for Java/Python Developers\nConceptPython/JavaRust\nFunctionNormal code that runsSame—runs at runtime\nAnnotation/Decorator@Override, @dataclass#[derive(...)] macro\nMacroDoesn't really existGenerates code at compile time\n\nThink of macros as super-powered annotations. In Java, annotations can generate some code (like Lombok does), but macros can generate any code.\nWhen to Use What?\n\nUse functions for normal logic and calculations.\nUse macros when you want to avoid boilerplate, create custom syntax, or generate code automatically.\n\nBottom Line\nMacros are Rust's way of reducing repetition and enabling metaprogramming. They run before compilation and rewrite your code. If you're coming from Java or Python, think of them as annotations or decorators on steroids—but they can do much more.\nFor most beginners, you don't need to write macros. The standard library macros like println!, vec!, and format! will carry you far. But understanding what they are helps when you read Rust code and wonder why you see ! everywhere.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Little Book of Rust Macros — A practical guide to writing macros in Rust.\nThe Rust Programming Language: Macros — Official Rust book chapter on macros.\nRust by Example: Macros — Interactive examples to learn macros.\nDomain-Specific Language (DSL) — Wikipedia article explaining the concept.\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-macros-vs-functions/","title":"Rust Macros vs Functions: What Java and Python Developers Should Know"},"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-serde-datetime-deserialization-error/":{"body":"I recently hit this error while working with a Rust application that reads from a database:\n\nAt first glance, it's a bit cryptic.

It may feel relentless at times, especially compared to more permissive languages like Python, JavaScript, or even Java. But here's the key: that friction is the point. Rust doesn't just run your code safely—it teaches you to think differently about correctness, safety, and performance.\nIn this post, we'll break down the key concepts that make Rust unique and walk through what the compiler enforces—and why that's a good thing in the long run.\n\n1. Strict Type System\nRust's type system is precise, and it expects you to be explicit about what types you're working with. There's no silent coercion between mismatched types. This can feel rigid at first, but it eliminates entire classes of bugs you'd otherwise only see at runtime.\nExample: Type mismatch\n\nRust won't implicitly convert between u32 and i32. You'll need to cast it explicitly:\n\nThis forces you to make conversion decisions intentionally and not by accident.\n\n2. Error Handling: No Exceptions\nRust does not have exceptions. Instead, it uses the Result&lt;T, E&gt; and Option&lt;T&gt; types for fallible operations. You must explicitly handle errors or propagate them. Ignoring them is not allowed.\nExample: Required handling of Result\n\nTo resolve this, you can either handle the error:\n\nOr propagate it using the ? operator in a function that returns a Result:\n\nThis enforces a programming style where failure is expected and dealt with.\n\n3. Immutability by Default\nVariables are immutable unless explicitly marked otherwise. This encourages predictability and thread-safety, even in single-threaded contexts.\nExample: Immutable variable\n\nThe correct way:\n\nThis simple rule helps reduce bugs from unintended mutation, especially in shared state.\n\n4. Ownership and Move Semantics\nRust enforces a unique ownership model. Every value in Rust has a single owner, and when that owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped. You can move ownership, borrow it temporarily, or clone the data.\nExample: Moved value error\n\nOnce ownership is transferred, you can no longer use the original. This prevents bugs like double-free or use-after-free that are common in C/C++.\n\n5. Borrowing Rules\nInstead of transferring ownership, you can borrow references. Borrowing can be either immutable (&amp;T) or mutable (&amp;mut T), but Rust enforces strict rules:\n\nYou can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time.\nOr one mutable borrow.\nBut not both.\n\nThis is enforced at compile time.\nInvalid example: Two mutable borrows\n\nThe compiler ensures that you never access memory from multiple places in ways that could cause race conditions or undefined behavior.\n\n6. Lifetimes\nLifetimes are Rust's way of tracking how long references are valid. The compiler uses lifetimes to prevent dangling references.\nExample: Dangling reference (compile error)\n\nRust will reject this code, saving you from accessing freed memory. Often, you'll write explicit lifetime annotations in function signatures when dealing with multiple references.\n\n7. Concurrency Without Data Races\nRust prevents data races at compile time using its ownership and borrowing rules. When you need to share mutable state between threads, you must use thread-safe abstractions like Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;.\nExample: Thread-safe counter\n\nIn many other languages, this would compile fine but possibly fail at runtime. In Rust, the compiler ensures that shared state is accessed safely.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRust asks a lot from the developer upfront. You'll be forced to think about ownership, lifetimes, mutability, and error paths very early in the process. But once your code compiles, it's often rock-solid. You'll find fewer runtime crashes, undefined behaviors, or memory leaks.\nMore importantly, Rust helps you develop habits that transfer to any language: understanding lifecycles, reducing shared mutable state, and always considering failure cases.\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe Rust Book\nRust by Example\nRustlings: Interactive CLI Exercises\ncheats.rs: Rust best practices\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/why-rust-makes-you-better-engineer/","title":"Why Rust Makes You a Better Engineer"}},"docInfo":{"https://noos.blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://noos.blog/posts/":{"body":11,"title":1},"https://noos.blog/posts/a-simple-word-definition-script/":{"body":105,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/ai-covers-on-autopilot/":{"body":444,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/":{"body":307,"title":7},"https://noos.blog/posts/connecting-dots/":{"body":226,"title":2},"https://noos.blog/posts/cursor-payments-confusion/":{"body":191,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/github-actions-when-automation-meets-reality/":{"body":1118,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/":{"body":271,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/how-embracing-rust-sharpens-the-mind/":{"body":533,"title":6},"https://noos.blog/posts/how-my-terminal-looks/":{"body":269,"title":2},"https://noos.blog/posts/jaxb-maven-xml-to-java/":{"body":139,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/jdk-9-and-jshell/":{"body":275,"title":3},"https://noos.blog/posts/linux-fancy-little-dialog-utility/":{"body":43,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/opensuse-13-1-almost-here/":{"body":74,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/redis-tls-deadpool-compatibility/":{"body":405,"title":6},"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-macros-vs-functions/":{"body":298,"title":8},"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-serde-datetime-deserialization-error/":{"body":154,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/why-rust-makes-you-better-engineer/":{"body":412,"title":4}},"length":19},"lang":"English"}
