## Who I Am

I'm **Oshadha G**, a software engineer passionate about building reliable, performant systems. I write about my experiences with programming, DevOps, and the tools that help me get things done.

This blog, **Noos**, is where I share my thoughts on technology, engineering practices, and the occasional hard-won lesson from the trenches. If you've ever wrestled with configuration files, spent hours debugging a deployment pipeline, or wondered why your perfectly reasonable code isn't working, you'll find kindred spirits here.

## What I Write About

Most of my content focuses on:

- **Rust**: Systems programming, memory safety, and the Rust ecosystem
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, infrastructure, automation, and the realities of deployment
- **Linux & Open Source**: Terminal workflows, system configuration, and the tools I use daily
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, debugging war stories, and lessons learned

I write from experience, not theory. You'll find real problems I've encountered, actual solutions that worked (and some that didn't), and honest reflections on what I wish I'd known sooner.

## Tech Stack

Here's what I work with:

- **Languages**: Rust, Python, JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Linux, Docker, GitHub Actions, Zola (this blog!)
- **Tools**: Terminal-first workflows, Vim, tmux
- **Interests**: Systems programming, distributed systems, performance optimization
