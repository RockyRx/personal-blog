## Who I Am

I'm **Oshadha**, a senior engineer passionate about building reliable, performant systems. My journey started in Java—Spring, Spring Boot, microservices, you name it. I cut my teeth on enterprise Java applications and learned the art of distributed systems the hard way.

But recently, I've been fascinated by **Rust**—its speed, memory safety, and the compiler's refreshingly rude honesty. I'm now diving deep into Rust with personal projects, exploring systems programming from a new angle. But I know my roots, and those Java lessons still shape how I think about architecture.

In my day job, I'm mostly into efforts—overseeing in AI/ML, building, and planning AI/ML pipelines for targeted clients. It's about battling the unknowns behind this new frontier and shaping features that grab users' attention. The journey from Java to AI to Rust has taught me that the best engineers aren't defined by their language, but by their ability to solve problems.

This blog, **Noos**, is where I share my thoughts on technology, engineering practices, and the occasional hard-won lesson from the trenches.

## What I Write About

My content spans:

- **Java & Spring**: Enterprise patterns, microservices architecture, and lessons from building large-scale systems
- **Rust**: Exploring systems programming, memory safety, and the Rust ecosystem as I learn
- **AI/ML Engineering**: Building robust ML pipelines, tackling the unknowns, and shipping production ML systems
- **Linux & Open Source**: Terminal workflows, system configuration, and the tools I use daily
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, infrastructure, automation, and the realities of deployment

I write from experience, not theory. You'll find real problems I've encountered, actual solutions that worked (and some that didn't), and honest reflections on what I wish I'd known sooner.

## Tech Stack

Here's what I work with:

- **Languages**: Java, Python, Rust, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, microservices architecture, Rust ecosystem
- **ML/AI**: Building and deploying ML pipelines, model serving, production ML systems
- **Infrastructure**: Linux, Docker, GitHub Actions, cloud platforms
- **Tools**: Terminal-first workflows, Vim, tmux
- **Interests**: Systems programming, distributed systems, performance optimization, ML engineering
